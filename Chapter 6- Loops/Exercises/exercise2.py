#A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; 
#if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. 
#Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket
