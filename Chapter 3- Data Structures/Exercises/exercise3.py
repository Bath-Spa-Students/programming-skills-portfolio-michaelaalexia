#Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
car = ["Jeep", "FJ Cruiser", "Koleos"]
print ("I would like to own a ", car[0], " car.")
print ("I would like to own a ", car[1], " car.")
print ("I would like to own a ", car[2], " car.")
